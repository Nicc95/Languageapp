Simple language learning app for toddler language traning.
Plan is to make an app that will make it easier for toddlers with language and/or motor disabilities to learn words, by making an app that shows an image and reads out a recording/TTS saying the word in identical toneage and pronounciation every time. This as research shows that toddlers with language issues benefits from identical tone and pronounciation when learning words.

Long term i am hoping to enable multi language support, but currently the main plan is Norwegian and English as these are my languages. If anyone feels like they can improve or assist in any way do reach out.

Idea came to me by using some similar apps when trying to help my son learn languages, he has some difficulties there. I found that the apps didnt really function as i wanted them to, and less than ideal in general.


I am also not great at coding, this is also a learning project for me so do take that into consideration when assessing and giving feedback if you would be so kind.
